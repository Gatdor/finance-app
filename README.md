How It All Works Together

     1. User Interaction:
o Users start by specifying the number of projects and entering details for each
project (initial investment, discount rate, and cashflows).
o Users can dynamically add or remove cashflows as needed.
      2. Data Processing:
o When the user clicks the "Calculate" button, the application validates inputs,
performs financial calculations, and updates the results section with calculated
metrics.
    3. Data Management:
o Users can save their current input data and reload it later, allowing for
persistent work sessions.
   4. Results Presentation:
Financial metrics are presented in a user-friendly format, with visual enhancements to
improve readability.
Detailed Explanation of Key Components


1. HTML Structure
o Input Fields: For entering the number of projects, initial investments,
discount rates, and cashflows.
o Buttons: To generate project inputs, calculate results, save, and load data.
o Results Display: Sections to show calculated results for each project.

2. JavaScript Functions
o Data Input Management: Functions to dynamically create and manage input
fields for projects and cashflows.
o Calculations: Functions that perform financial analyses based on user inputs.
o Data Storage: Functions to save and retrieve data using local storage.

3. User Interactions
o Adding/Removing Cashflows: Users can dynamically add or remove
cashflow fields as needed.
o Calculation: Users input data and click a button to perform calculations and
view results.
o Saving/Loading Data: Users can save their data to local storage and load it
back later.

4. Styling and Animations
o CSS Classes: Used for styling input fields, results, and animations (e.g., fade-

This application offers a comprehensive tool for financial analysis, allowing users to manage
and analyze multiple projects with dynamic input capabilities and robust financial
calculations.
